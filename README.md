## About the Parish

The earliest documented presence of Orthodoxy in Toruń dates back to 1668. Between 1724 and 1756, an Orthodox church already existed in Toruń, serving a community that varied in size from several dozen to several hundred believers.

The Orthodox Parish of Toruń was officially opened on April 28, 1921. The current wooden parish church was completed and consecrated in 1929, originally constructed in 1839 and adapted from a former monastery building in 1939.
